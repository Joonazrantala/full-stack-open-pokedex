We have a Python application in development, and soon it will be ready to be released. Here I will discuss a few important things related to Continuous Integration, to ensure high-quality code and a working application.

For linting, we can choose a Python linter like flakeheaven, and should configure it to be ran every time there is a pull request with a .py file, meaning there is new Python code. This is to maintain consistend coding standards and catch common mistakes early on. Python tests should also be configured to be ran every time a pull request to main is made, and is most commonly done with pytest libary. You should commit often and separate your work into small chunks, so that it's easier to find out where to possible bugs are. Python is an interpreted language, so it actually might not need a build step at all. 

Most common tools to setup CI are the self-hosted Jenkins and cloud-based GitHub Actions. Several alternatives do exist, like the cloud-hosted Azure Pipelines from Microsoft, or GitLab CI/CD for teams already using GitLab for version control.

To make the choice between a self-hosted or cloud system, you need to consider a few things. A cloud-based system like GitHub Actions is easier to set up, and you don't need your own hardware for it. Self-hosted setup Jenkins is very flexible, but quite difficult to configure. However, it's flexibility and the possibility to update your own system with better hardware offer bigger companies with big teams more capacity. For my 6-person single-team project, the cloud-based GitHub Actions is probably a good choice.
